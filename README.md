![Bryant-Denny Stadium](images/stadium.png)

This survey was conducted to identifying important correlations in the fan experience at an Alabama Football game in Tuscaloosa.

## Sample Size Demographics
I personally designed the survey using Google Forms and collected responses from: Facebook, LinkedIn, and Reddit. The sample size is too small to extract any accurate insights but it displays ways of identifying important correlations in the fan/guest experience using survey data. These correlations will help live event experience decision making related to: branding, marketing and ticket package development.
